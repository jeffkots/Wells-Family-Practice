            In order for that to occur, we ask that you arrive for your appointment at least five to

            twenty minutes early to fill out paperwork.

          <h3>Prescription Refills</h3>
          <p>
            The best medical care occurs when you are seen regularly. If you have not been seen for
            a while for an ongoing issue, or you are requesting a prescription for a new problem, we
            may insist on an office visit.
            <strong

                >We cannot effectively, and in most cases will not, treat problems over the

              ></strong
            >
            Prescriptions are best refilled at the time of your office visit. If for some reason you
            are in need of a refill, please call during business hours and allow a turnaround time
            of two business days. For your convenience we have an automated prescription refill line
            at
            <span class="phone-number">(207) 646-2372</span>.

        <div class="policy-group">
          <h3>Insurance</h3>
          <p>
            Although we make every effort to have a general working knowledge of individual
            insurance policies, the sheer number of them makes it impossible for us to know
            specifics.
            <strong
              ><u
                >Knowledge of the details of your insurance policy and its requirements is your
                responsibility.</u
              ></strong
            >
            The insurance company and your employer can assist you in this effort. It is important
            when speaking with your insurer to obtain documentation such as the date you spoke with
            them, who you spoke with, as well as the details of your conversation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-group">
          <h3>Referrals</h3>
          <p>
            Some insurance companies require you to have referrals â€” a kind of authorization â€” to
            see specialists or receive certain tests or studies.
            <strong
              ><u
                >It is the patient's responsibility to know if they need a referral, whether the
                specialist is in their insurance network, and to make sure the referral has been
                completed before seeking specialty care outside of Wells Family Practice.</u
              ></strong
            >
            In most cases you will be required to schedule an appointment with us so we can evaluate
            and assess your needs and facilitate the referral process. This is good, sound,
            efficient medical care.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general, referrals can only be done prior to seeing a specialist and are often time
            consuming to obtain.
            <strong><u>We will not back-date referrals.</u></strong>
            Please allow as much time as possible for us to obtain your referral. We require at
            least three business days to obtain a referral and will need the reason you are seeking
            care, with whom, and the date of service. This is important because, if not done, you
            may be financially responsible for the service.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important, and in your best interest, for us to be involved in your medical care.
            We reserve time in our schedule for same-day or next-day appointments.
            <strong
              ><u
                >Please understand that we will not provide referrals for non-urgent visits to
                ambulatory care facilities or emergency rooms.</u
              ></strong
            >
            If you are seen in one of those facilities and are referred to a specialist, it is
            important to make a follow-up appointment with us so that we can expedite and advocate
            on your behalf for any additional care needed.

          <h3>Financial Responsibilities</h3>
          <p>
            Please be aware that co-payments are collected prior to your office visit and are
            expected at the time of service. For your convenience we accept MasterCard and Visa as
            well as personal checks and cash. Please bring your insurance card to every appointment
            and make us aware of any changes in your insurance coverage or personal information such
            as address or phone numbers. If you do not have insurance, payment is expected at the
            time of service. Even if you have insurance you are still responsible for any unpaid
            balances!
